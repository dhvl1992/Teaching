            <h2>Why Study Management History?</h2>
            <div class="content-area">
                <p>Think about the last time you organized a group project or planned a family event. You were using management principles that have evolved over thousands of years. Understanding management theory is like learning the history of human problem-solving.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    Real Example: The Egyptian pyramids required coordinating tens of thousands of workers for fifteen years. This massive undertaking used sophisticated management techniques, proving that management has ancient roots.
                </div>
                
                <p>However, studying management as a science - with theories, principles, and systematic approaches - only began about 120 years ago. Just like medicine evolved from folk remedies to scientific practice, management evolved from intuition to systematic study.</p>
                
                <div class="accent-box">
                    Think of management theory as a toolkit that has been refined through trial, error, and scientific study. Each school of thought adds different tools to this kit.

        <!-- Taylor Introduction -->
        <div class="slide title-content">
            <h2>Meet Frederick Taylor (1856-1915) - The Father of Scientific Management</h2>
            <div class="content-area">
                <p>Imagine working in a factory where everyone does their job differently. Some workers are fast, others slow. Some use one method, others use completely different approaches. There's no standard way to do anything. This was the reality Frederick Taylor observed in the early 1900s.</p>
                
                <div class="definition-box">
                    <strong>Taylor's Revolutionary Idea:</strong> Instead of leaving work methods to chance or tradition, let's use science to find the most efficient way to do everything.
                </div>
                
                <p>Taylor saw workers deliberately working below their capacity - a problem he called "soldiering." He discovered this happened because workers feared that working efficiently would lead to higher standards without higher pay. They also lacked proper training in efficient methods.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    Taylor's Scientific Approach: He observed workers, timed their activities, measured their output, and experimented with different methods - just like a scientist studying nature.
                </div>
                
                <p>This was revolutionary because before Taylor, most work was done "the way we've always done it." He proved that systematic study could dramatically improve both efficiency and worker wages.</p>

        <!-- Taylor's Four Principles -->
        <div class="slide title-content">
            <h2>Taylor's Four Scientific Principles</h2>
            <div class="content-area">
                <p>Think of these as a recipe for transforming any chaotic work situation into an efficient, systematic operation. Each principle builds on the others to create a comprehensive approach.</p>
                
                <div class="principle-item">
                    <strong>Principle 1: Scientific Study of Work</strong><br>
                    Replace rule-of-thumb methods with scientifically determined procedures. Study every tiny movement and find the most efficient way to do each task - like finding the fastest route to school through careful timing and analysis.
                </div>
                
                <div class="principle-item">
                    <strong>Principle 2: Scientific Selection and Training</strong><br>
                    Choose workers who have the right skills and motivation for each specific job, then train them properly in the scientifically-proven best method instead of expecting them to "figure it out yourself."
                </div>
                
                <div class="principle-item">
                    <strong>Principle 3: Cooperation Between Management and Workers</strong><br>
                    Create a partnership where management handles planning and workers focus on execution. Both parties work together toward shared goals rather than being adversaries.
                </div>
                
                <div class="principle-item">
                    <strong>Principle 4: Division of Responsibility</strong><br>
                    Management becomes responsible for work design, planning, and creating proper conditions. Workers become responsible for following scientific methods and meeting performance standards.
                </div>
                
                <div class="accent-box">
                    Real Result: When Taylor applied these principles to loading iron at a steel company, productivity increased by 300%! Workers went from loading 12.5 tons per day to 47 tons per day.

                <p>Understanding these foundational concepts helps you develop a comprehensive approach to leadership and organization that you'll use throughout your career and personal life.</p>

                    The Evolution Pattern: Management thinking progressed from intuition → systematic efficiency → human psychology → situational flexibility. Each phase built upon previous knowledge while addressing its limitations.

                    Taylor's Lasting Legacy: His emphasis on systematic analysis, measurement, and continuous improvement remains valuable today. However, his limitations remind us to consider human factors and situational variables in our approach.

                <p>As you encounter management challenges in your career and personal life, draw on these historical insights while adapting them to contemporary realities. The goal isn't to apply any single approach rigidly, but to understand the tools available and choose appropriate methods for specific situations.</p>
                
                <div class="definition-box">
                    <strong>The Ultimate Insight:</strong> Effective management serves human purposes - creating value for customers, providing meaningful work for employees, and contributing to societal well-being. The techniques and theories you study are means to these ends, not ends in themselves.
                </div>
                
                <p>Remember that management is both art and science. Use systematic thinking and measurement (the science) combined with empathy, creativity, and situational awareness (the art) to become an effective leader and contributor to any organization.</p>

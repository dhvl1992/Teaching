                <p>As your professor, I want you to understand why these winters happened and what we can learn from them:</p>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    Lesson #1: Manage Expectations
                </div>
                <p>Both winters were caused by <span class="emphasis">overpromising and underdelivering</span>. Researchers got so excited about possibilities that they forgot about practical limitations.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    Lesson #2: Technology Needs Time to Mature
                </div>
                <p>Many ideas from the early days (like neural networks) were actually good - they just needed more powerful computers and better algorithms to work properly.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    Lesson #3: Credibility Is Fragile
                </div>
                <p>It takes years to build trust and only a few failed promises to destroy it. The AI community learned this the hard way - twice!</p>

            <div class="content-area">
                <p>Artificial Intelligence represents humanity's ambitious goal of creating machines that can "think." The field began in the 1950s with a simple but profound question: Can machines exhibit intelligent behavior?</p>

                    Modern Definition: "The study and design of intelligent agents, where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success."
                </div>
                
                <p>Here's what makes this interesting: AI doesn't necessarily require learning. For decades, the dominant approach was <span class="emphasis">symbolic AI</span>, where programmers explicitly wrote rules. Think of early chess programs that followed thousands of hand-coded strategies like "control the center" or "protect your king."</p>
                
                <p>This approach worked brilliantly for logical, rule-based problems like chess, but struggled with fuzzy, real-world challenges. How do you write explicit rules for recognizing your grandmother's face in a photo, or understanding sarcasm in speech? These limitations led us to seek a different approach.</p>

            <h2>Machine Learning: A Paradigm Shift</h2>
            <div class="content-area">
                <p>Machine Learning emerged as a revolutionary response to symbolic AI's limitations. Instead of programming explicit rules, we realized we could let machines discover patterns themselves.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    Core Insight: Rather than telling computers HOW to solve problems, we show them examples of solved problems and let them figure out the patterns.
                </div>
                
                <p>This represents a fundamental shift in thinking. Traditional programming follows this logic:</p>
                <div class="formula">Data + Program → Output</div>
                
                <p>But machine learning flips this equation:</p>
                <div class="formula">Data + Desired Output → Program (Model)</div>
                
                <p>This "program" we create is called a model, and it captures the learned patterns from our examples. Once trained, we can apply this model to new, unseen data to make predictions or decisions.</p>
                
                <p>Think of it like teaching a child to recognize animals. Instead of describing every possible feature of a cat, you show them hundreds of pictures labeled "cat" and "not cat." Eventually, they learn to recognize cats they've never seen before. Machine learning works similarly, but with mathematical precision.</p>

The first layer might detect edges in an image, the second layer combines edges into shapes, the third layer combines shapes into objects, and so on.</p>

                <p>Notice how this framework forces us to be specific. We can't just say "learn to play checkers better." We must define exactly what constitutes the task, what data we'll use for learning, and how we'll measure improvement.</p>

                <h3>Bridging the Gap</h3>
                <p>Semi-supervised learning addresses a common real-world problem: you have lots of data, but only a small portion is labeled.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Why This Matters:</strong><br>
                    • Labeling data is expensive<br>
                    • Requires human experts<br>
                    • Time-consuming process<br>
                    • Unlabeled data is abundant
                </div>
                
                <p><strong>Core Assumption:</strong> If two data points are close together in a high-density region, they likely have similar labels.</p>
                
                <div class="accent-box">
                    Strategy: Use unsupervised learning to understand data structure, then use supervised learning to propagate labels through similar regions.

Finally, when we encounter new data, we extract the same features and apply our learned model to make predictions. This pipeline represents the fundamental pattern underlying all machine learning applications.
